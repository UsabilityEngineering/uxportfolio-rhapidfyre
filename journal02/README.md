Thanks to the lockdowns, I've increased my use of Discord including both for school and personal matters. It's really come out to show it's power in handling the things it claims to do over the last month, even though I've seen its potential long before that. In this journal entry, we're going to look at Discord, examine it's positives and negatives, and how the technology serves us in today's world from all aspects: Gamer, student or non-gamer.

## What is Discord
Discord is a program that can be used either in a browser (original purpose), a desktop application, or a mobile application. It's a program that allows you to communicate with others via text or voice channels, based on your membership of a "server". A server is essentially a group on Discord that you have to be invited to join, or create yourself, hosted on Discord's cloud services. Once you're a member of a server, the owners and administrators of that server have set up channels that you can see & use based on the permissions they believe that each person should have. This can be as simple as a group of friends who have a basic Discord server to chat to each other when they're playing games, or as large as an entire computer science Discord server with tons of channels and a scripted computer program to assign permissions to people to see specific channels. Users can join and leave voice channels whenever they want, change their username for each Discord server, and change servers seamlessly just by clicking on a different server's icon.

## What Discord Does Right
I have been thoroughly impressed with Discord to the point that I have it on each of my devices, and use it daily. I use Discord for three purposes: Gaming, school and professional. I own my own Discord server for a community that I develop scripts for, I'm a member of numerous servers that I either play games on as well as a server I use for help with coursework, and I'm an administrator for a server that my in-person friends use to stay connected. This has given me a huge range of experience with Discord, not only limited to the basic chat and server features, but things such as automated scripts ("bots") that do as much as play music for you, welcome people who join your server, give you the daily news, report your server's status and errors.

* **Effective**: Discord is highly effective at solving the issue of having multiple chat programs for multiple groups, or multiple voice servers for various things. Whether you're a gamer, a small business, a gaming community, a school, a classroom or even co-workers in an office - Discord is very handy, lightweight, secure and even fun to use.
* **Learnable**: Discord's learning curve is very small. It's very easy to hop right in, join some servers (they use a universal language of signs and logos to get the point across) and registration is easy.
* **Useful**:
