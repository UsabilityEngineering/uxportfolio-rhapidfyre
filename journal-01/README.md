 ## Overview
 ![Zoll X Monitor](https://github.com/UsabilityEngineering/uxportfolio-rhapidfyre/blob/master/assets/zoll_x.jpg)
  The first bit of technology that is used in everyday life is the Zoll X Series Monitor, which is a vital sign monitor and analysis tool for Emergency Medical Services (EMS). Chances are, if you've seen an ambulance work on a loved one, a friend or a neighbor, you've witnessed the Zoll X in use. Within this journal entry, we will be examining the key aspects of usability:
  - *Effective*: How well does the technology solve the problem? (A problem is something such as changing your brake pads)
  - *Efficient*: How easily does the technology solve the problem?
  - *Safe*: Is it safe to use the technology / Does it solve the problem in a safe manner?
  - *Satisfying*: Is it satisfying to use the technology?
  - *Learnable*: Is the technology easy to learn and use?
  - *Memorable*: Can you remember how to use the technology?
  - *Useful*: Is the technology useful for solving the problem?
  - *Error Tolerant*: If a mistake is made can the technology easily overcome or present the issue to the user?
 
 ## What it does right
 ![Pediatric Patient](https://github.com/UsabilityEngineering/uxportfolio-rhapidfyre/blob/master/assets/pediatric.jpg)
  This monitor is a highly sophisticated device used for analysing heart rythyms, blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, carbonmonoxide level monitoring, and more. The device also has the ability to administer manual defribillation of the heart, pacing, and can even monitor and defibrillate pediatric patients.
  
  ##### #1: Usefulness
  The Zoll X Monitor is, above all else, an extremely useful tool to have. Paramedics and EMTs rely on the tool everyday to display important vitals, automate the blood pressure and other processes so that they can focus on patient care and timely transport to a nearby medical facility. The Zoll Monitor can take blood pressure, heart rythyms and more completely automated while the medical personnel use the time to tend to the patient.
  
  ##### #2: Effectiveness
  The Zoll X Monitor when properly used by a trained professional, is very efficient at solving the problem. The monitor is able to analyize vital signs and heart rythyms with great accuracy, even in a moving ambulance. However, the monitor does suffer from false indications on the rythym analysis occasionally (mostly through no fault of the developers or engineers) due to dramatic movements or special circumstances. Barring any of those factors, the X Monitor will analyize vital signs and display the results without fail.
  
  ##### #3: Memorable
  While the Zoll X Monitor is not very learnable, it's extremely memorable due to the minimal interaction it requires to navigate the system. Once a user is familiar with how to put in user information, navigate menus to obtain the settings they need or set up defibrilation, the method to get to these becomes rather simple. Only a short number of menus will take you where you need to go, and the buttons use a universal language to everyone: Pictures. You are no more than 2-3 button presses away from the information you need to get the monitor working. The human brain easily remembers not only pictures, but simplicity. The easier something is to access, the easier it is to remember.
  
  ## What it does wrong
 ![Not User Friendly](https://github.com/UsabilityEngineering/uxportfolio-rhapidfyre/blob/master/assets/complicated.jpg)
  Many paramedics and EMTs-alike constantly fight with the device for simple tasks such as putting in names or transmitting the results to the hospital. In the EMS sector, Paramedics and EMTs are required to delay by stopping and taking a minute or two out of patient care & treatment to input information into the system in an ancient manner. A minute or two or messing with technology can be detrimental to the patient's health or transport time. Another common problem with this device is network connectivity.
  
  ##### #1: Learnability
  As the photograph above demonstrates, there's a lot of information going on with these monitors. With several menus that include several submenus, it can be a daunting task to learn what all you can do with it. Even once a user knows how to navigate the menus, there are several information display windows that change their layout everytime you chance the info you need. The main screen will show a basic heart rythym, oxygen saturation, respiration rate and blood pressure... However, when you change the system to EKG mode, more vital signs are added, and the ones aforementioned will be in a completely new location.
  
  ##### #2: Error Tolerance
  Probably the most frustration thing about this device aside from it's learnability is it's inability to error handle. Mistakes are not easily forgiven by the X Monitor. If the road is too bumpy, if the blood pressure cuff is not attached properly or the finger reader is clipped onto a finger that's been painted the machine will simply not handle the situation. If the road is too bumpy, the blood pressure cuff will literally reinflate 2-3 times and just give up with a "Cannot read" error. If the cuff is not attached properly, it will inflate the cuff and proceed anyway, giving a "Cannot read" error when it fails to ascertain the pressure. If the finger reader can't read a pulse rate or oxygen saturation because of finger nail polish or something, it will just show an empty vital sign set and wait for it to read one. While the system has a built in alarm to notify the technician of any failures to obtain vital signs, the alarm usually only goes off once it starts detecting vitals and loses them - Not when it can't obtain them to begin with.
  Another very common issue with the monitor is when paramedics are required to send their EKG analysis to the hospital ahead of transport. If the internet is down on the ambulance or the monitor can't establish a connection, the only indication that your transmission will or has failed is a small antenna icon on the machine that will be red or yellow. Technicians can be half way to the hospital before they realize their analysis was never dispatched to the receiving facility.
  
  ##### #3: Efficiency
  The X Monitor is not very efficient at what it does, hence the Error Tolerance entry above. While the monitor is very effective in it's duties, it can be complicated to get it to perform the duty needed and it must be set up properly. If the system is not set up properly, there's little indication as to what's going on. The finger clip does not have the machine report "Unable to read pulse" or similar. The blood pressure cuff does not give a "Check Cuff Strap" error. Sometimes you have to run an EKG strip twice. If the blood pressure can't be read, there's no indication of what's going on - It just tries 3 times and then gives up.
  
  Overall, the X Monitor, while effective and a very useful machine, it could have serious improvements to the usability of the device by being more error tolerance, user friendly and efficient. Emergency Medical Technicians both Basic and Paramedic use this device. Making it easier for them to use it gives the technician time to focus on the patient and not the machine, which ultimately provides better patient care and makes for an overall more effective transport.
